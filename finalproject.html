                  we are colloboratively working together as the whole class to
                  collect the geospatial data of different sounds across New
                  York University Abu Dhabi campus, visualize, analyse, and take
                  out key trends and observations from them. Together, we
                  collected a total of 674 data points over a duration of 52
                  days (from 27<sup>th</sup> March 2022 to 18<sup>th</sup> May
                  2022).

                <p>
                  The key idea of the project is not to come up with an
                  objective sound-map of the campus, but rather to pay attention
                  to the sounds on the campus and listen with extra attention to
                  find out the patterns and trends about the campus we have not
                  discovered before.

                <p>
                  Our campus, shown above, is located on a sandy island.
                  However, the campus architecture features a good proportion of
                  concrete and nature. Therefore, we expect a significant
                  recordings of nature sounds.

                  For the data collection, each student uses their mobile phone
                  to record the data of the sound - not the sound itself. The
                  students are allowed to record the data at any time, at any
                  place on campus so long as 20 data points per week requirement
                  is met. Survey123 Application by ArcGIS is used by the
                  students on their phones to note down the details of the
                  sound, as shown below.

                <p>
                  Initially, we plotted the data points of our entire raw
                  dataset on the map of New York University Abu Dhabi campus as
                  follows (Click on white points to see details about each
                  sound). It can be seen that the data is relatively well
                  spreaded across the campus, with slight concentration at the
                  campus center. If you drag the map below up, you will see a
                  lone outlier datapoint across Laffan Street. We highly suspect
                  that datapoint is there due to the GPS approximation error.
                  Otherwise, students have been widespread across the campus and
                  have collected various sounds such as music, footsteps,
                  screaming students 😱, professors talking, just to name a few.
                </p>
                <div id="map_1" class="Leafletmap"></div>
                <p style="text-align: center">Interactive Figure : Raw Data</p>

                <p>
                  However, this visualization of raw data does not tell much
                  except to reveal the contents of the data. Therefore, for our
                  next exploration, we will only be plotting the data points
                  collected by the two authors (names anonymised on data points
                  for privacy reasons). As seen in graph below, only the data
                  points by the authors are selected and visualized. Different
                  colors indicate different persons. Radius of datapoint
                  indicates the floor (e.g. larger radius means the data is
                  collected on a higher floor).
                </p>
                <p>
                  It can be seen that each of the authors mostly spend their
                  time on one side of the campus only. It can also be seen that
                  the data points of same color with large radii are
                  concentrated in two parts of the campus only. This is the
                  place where each of the author spends most of their time at
                  (e.g. their dorm rooms). This means that from this data
                  visualization, one is able to guess the details about the
                  dwellings of the authors without actually knowing the exact
                  information 🤯. It has been discussed in class that similar
                  techniques are used by big tech companies to determine ones'
                  house locations.However, it is shocking that same analysis can
                  generate the results from a handful of data points we
                  collected in class.

                </p>

                <p>
                  Moreover, we will also perform filters in the overall dataset
                  to find patterns. In the visualization below, each of the data
                  point is color coded by their categories (<b
                    style="color: #55a1e5"
                    >Blue
                  </b>
                  = Machine, <b style="color: #ec526c">Red</b> = Human,
                  <b style="color: #67ce71">Green</b> = Natural, <b>White</b> =
                  Other). Again, the radii represents the height above ground
                  (larger radius = higher). It can be seen clearly that many of
                  the blue data points have large radii, and green radii has the
                  smallest data points except one or two. It means that the
                  higher above the ground, there are more machine sounds, and
                  the closer to the ground, there are more nature sounds. This
                  is definitely expected due to the architecture of our campus,
                  and is reflected in the data visualization.

                <p>
                  It can be seen that apart from the word 'sound', 'bird' is the
                  word which is most commonly used to describe the sounds on
                  campus, followed by 'music'. Therefore, it can be said that
                  the campus is green enough to attract all the birds. As seen
                  in bar graph below, the frequency of the use of word 'bird' is
                  significantly more than other words used to describe the
                  sound.

                <p>
                  It may seem as a contradiction that although the 'Machine' is
                  the most frequent category of the sounds reported, 'Bird' is
                  the most frequent word used to describe the sounds. However,
                  it simply means that
                  <i
                    >there are many more machines sounds than the bird sounds on
                    campus, but the machine sounds are so diverse (e.g. AC,
                    engines, vents) so that not one word can be used to describe
                    them.</i
                  >
                  Therefore, this finding suggests that the campus is mostly
                  filled with machine sounds, which are dull.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Last but not least, the data points containing two most common
                  words to describe the sounds (Bird and Music) is plotted
                  separately below. Again, the radii represents the height above
                  ground.

                <p style="text-align: center">Interactive Figure : Birds</p>
                <p>
                  It can be seen that although the birds are frequent and
                  concentrated at campus center on the ground, students also
                  hear them while they are at their 6th floor dorm rooms, on the
                  sides of the campus.

                <p>
                  Similar argument above can be also made for music. It seems
                  when not at the campus center, students seem to listen to
                  music (or hear music) high above the ground in their dorm
                  rooms (except in dining halls, which always play music and are
                  located on the ground).

                    Students mostly either stay at the campus center on ground
                    floor, or inside their dorm rooms high above the ground.
                    They do not usually go to other areas to campus to collect

                  as follows.
                </p>
                <p><b>What can sousveillance on our campus teach you? </b></p>
                <p>
                  It made us more aware and conscious of sounds on campus as we
                  collected them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b
                    >To ask Lamden's question, what does this soundmapping
                    exercise "have to do with privacy?"</b
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  It in a way violates the privacy of the students as it can
                  create a map of where they go everyday and what sounds mostly
                  stand out to them.
                </p>

                  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through cleaning the data collected from Survey123 (cleaning
                  the raw data), we can analyze the cleaned data and generate
                  information based on that.
                </p>

                    >What might you do with the data from this exercise to make
                    campus a better place? or to tell an interesting story about
                    campus to someone who has never been there?
                  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We think that we can look at where unpleasant loud sounds were
                  heard and work on implementing techniques on campus to reduce
                  those sounds. Moreover, we believe that if we play most of the
                  sounds collected for every location on campus to an external
                  person who has never been on campus, they would have a great
                  idea of what a regular student's experience on campus is,
                  without setting foot on campus.

                </p>
                <p>
                  We would set reminders at constant times throughout the day to
                  collect data. We would also make it obligatory to visit a new
                  spot on campus and collect sounds from there at least once a
                  week to make sure that the data collected is overall more
                  encompassing.

                    analyzing the various fields, time and date stamps, do you
                    think we have a good sample of observations about campus? a
                    "good enough" sample? If you think that we need more data,
                    how would we go about that process?

                </p>
                <p>
                  Because we went to the same set of places everyday, and
                  collected the sounds that we observed, we think that the range
                  of sounds was not as much as we expected it to be.
                  Nevertheless, we were quite underwhelmed by the range of
                  different sounds all across campus.
                </p>

                  <b
                    >What kinds of sounds were noticed by the data collectors on
                    campus? How much variety is there? What are the outliers?
                  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We mainly noticed that students recorded sounds of birds
                  chirping, crickets, professors speaking, and AC sounds. The
                  most commonly used words to describe the sounds are mentioned
                  above.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b
                    >Did we accomplish the act of "listening with" our campus?
                    Can you say that you have a new kind of awareness of, or
                    connectedness with, the space in which we live? are we able
                    to show empathy for others using data? or does the mapping
                    process simply reinforce our resignation or surveillance
                    realism? or does it reinforce the "atomisation" of
                    individual action (Hintz et al)?</b
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is definitely a new kind of awareness achieved from this
                  exercise. As we have to remember to record about twenty sounds
                  a week, we now activate a new sense of listening closely “with
                  campus” and recording any sounds that we observe.

                    >Could this project have been carried out by non-human
                    actors?
                  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the non-human actors moved around campus daily and explored
                  different places on campus, then for sure they can even do it
                  better than humans 🤖! However, some machine learning would
                  have to happen prior to that by humans.

                  <b
                    >What do you think that machine learning might make of the

                  It could classify certain areas around campus with the sounds
                  that are most frequent there. It can then use this information
                  to know where people mostly gathered at. In addition, it can
                  identify any devices malfunctioning. For instance, if the
                  sound if an AC is not present at its usual frequency, it means
                  the AC is broken.

                  To us, the final project is akin to what we did during the
                  screening of 32 Sounds, a film by
                  <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sam_Green">Sam Green</a>
                  . During the screening of the film, we were asked to listen to
                  the silence for a minute. As we go quiet for a long time, our
                  sense of hearing deepens and we are able to hear sounds that
                  we did not hear before. In this project, we are doing the same
                  thing, but on the campus wide scale.
